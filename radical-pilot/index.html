            <p class="infoblurb" align="justify">

              RADICAL-Pilot (formerly known as BigJob) is a flexible Pilot framework that takes the headache out of job and data management for clusters, grids, and clouds. RADICAL-Pilot is written in the Python programming language, and as such is easily deployable into user space. It allows user-level control of Pilots and supports a wide range of application types. It is built on top of The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA), a high-level, easy-to-use API for accessing distributed resources, meaning RADICAL-Pilot works on a variety of backends such as PBS, SGE, Amazon EC2, etc.

        <h2>What are Pilot-Jobs</h2>
      </div>      
            <p class="infoblurb" align="justify">
Pilot-Jobs support the decoupling of workload submission from resource assignment. This results in a flexible execution model, which in turn enables the distributed scale-out of applications on multiple and possibly heterogeneous resources. Pilot-Jobs support the use of container jobs with sophisticated workflow management to coordinate the launch and interaction of actual computational tasks within the container. It allows the execution of jobs without the necessity to queue each individual job.
            </p>

             <p class="infoblurb" align="justify">
RADICAL-Pilot's main focus is to be a flexible and extensible Pilot-based system for job submission and data management. Unlike many other Pilot-Job systems, RADICAL-Pilot natively supports MPI jobs and, because of its integration with saga-python, works on a variety of backend systems.

        <h2>What is RADICAL-Pilot used for</h2>
      </div>      
            <p class="infoblurb" align="justify">
RADICAL-Pilot is used by scientists and engineers to solve real problems, such as protein-folding, traditional molecular dynamics umbrella sampling, replica exchange, and other data/compute intensive workloads.

        <h2>Why Pilot-Jobs</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="lead">Simple Setup, Thousands of Jobs, Less Worry</p>

  <p class="infoblurb" align="justify">
Production-grade distributed cyberinfrastructure almost always has a local resource manager installed, such as a batch queuing system. A distributed application often requires many jobs to produce useful output data; these jobs often have the same executable. A traditional way of submitting these jobs would be to submit an individual job for each executable. These jobs (often hundreds) sit in the batch queuing system and may not become active at the same time. Load and scheduling variations may add unnecessary hours to a job's total time to completion due to inefficiencies in scheduling many individual jobs.
  </p>

<p class="infoblurb" align="justify">
A Pilot-Job provides an alternative approach. It can be thought of as a container job for many sub-jobs. A Pilot-Job acquires the resources necessary to execute the sub-jobs (thus, it asks for all of the resources required to run the sub-jobs, rather than just one sub-job). If a system has a batch queue, the Pilot-Job is submitted to this queue. Once it becomes active, it can run the sub-jobs directly, instead of having to wait for each sub-job to queue. This eliminates the need to submit a different job for every executable and significantly reduces the time-to-completion.
